## Learning Machine Learning

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning Machine Learning by building concepts from first principles.
Instead of relying on high-level libraries from the start, the focus here is on understanding the mathematics, logic, and intuition behind common ML algorithms.

The work primarily involves implementing algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy, exploring ideas like vectorization, cost functions, and gradient descent, and analyzing how models behave under different conditions.
The goal is to develop a strong conceptual foundation that makes advanced models and frameworks easier to reason about later.

This repo evolves as my understanding deepens and new topics are explored.
