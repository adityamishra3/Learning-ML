# My Brain on ML

Welcome to my humble abode of machine learning experiments. This is where I document my journey from a mere mortal to a machine learning connoisseur (or at least someone who can pretend to be one at parties). Expect a mix of brilliant insights, spectacular failures, and a whole lot of `print('hello world')`.

## What's Inside?

I've tried to keep things organized, so you can find what you're looking for without too much trouble. Here's the lay of the land:

-   `fundamentals`: The bread and butter. Here you'll find the foundational concepts I'm wrestling with, like linear regression and exploratory data analysis. It's like the gym for my data muscles.
-   `libraries`: A collection of notebooks dedicated to specific libraries. Because why reinvent the wheel when you can just `import` it?
-   `misc`: The drawer of miscellaneous socks. This is where I put things that don't quite fit anywhere else. It's a bit of a wild west in here, so enter at your own risk.

## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to clone, fork, or just browse around. If you find something useful, great! If you find a bug, well, that's just a feature I haven't named yet.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning project, so I'm not actively looking for contributions. But if you have a brilliant idea, feel free to open an issue and we can chat.

**Warning:** I'm not responsible for any existential crises that may arise from trying to understand the math in the `mathematics.md` file. You have been warned.
